# End_To_End_Walmart_Sales_Data_Analysis
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data analysis pipeline using Walmart’s sales dataset to extract business insights using SQL for data querying and Python for visualization &amp; reporting. It is designed as a beginner-friendly yet practical case study to simulate real-world analytical tasks.
🔧 Tools & Technologies:
Tool->Purpose
MySQL->SQL querying and analysis
Python->Data manipulation & visualization
Pandas->Data preprocessing
Seaborn/Matplotlib->Charting and EDA
SQLAlchemy->MySQL-Python connection
Jupyter->Interactive coding & visualization

🔍 Steps Performed:
1. Data Import & Preprocessing
Uploaded dataset to MySQL using pandas.to_sql()

Checked for duplicates, NULLs, data type mismatches

Converted date & time columns to appropriate formats

2. SQL-Based Data Analysis
Performed various queries to extract insights:

🔢 Total Sales by Branch, City, and Product Category

📆 Monthly & Daily Trends

📊 Peak Transaction Time Analysis (Morning, Afternoon, Evening)

💳 Popular Payment Methods

🌟 Average Customer Ratings

🎯 Best Performing Product Categories

📈 Revenue Change Between 2022 & 2023

Used CTEs, date functions, window functions (e.g., RANK)

3. Python Visualizations
Bar plots for branch-wise & category-wise sales

Pie charts for gender/customer type distribution

Line charts for time series analysis

Heatmaps for rating vs. total sales

📈 Key Insights:
Branch A had the highest revenue, especially on weekends

Electronic Accessories was the most profitable category

Afternoon was the busiest time for all branches

Digital payments were the most preferred method

Revenue grew by X% from 2022 to 2023 (based on SQL analysis)

✅ Skills Demonstrated:
Advanced SQL querying (CTEs, GROUP BY, RANK, DATE_FORMAT)

Data cleaning & analysis in Python

Business-oriented insight generation

Visual storytelling using charts
